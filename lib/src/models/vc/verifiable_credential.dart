/// A model representing a Verifiable Credential (VC) as defined by the W3C Verifiable Credentials standard.
///
/// A Verifiable Credential is a tamper-evident, cryptographically secure document containing claims
/// about a subject. It allows entities to present trusted information, issued by a credential issuer,
/// to verifiers.
///
/// **Key Properties:**
/// - [context]: JSON-LD context defining namespaces and terms used in the credential.
/// - [id]: A unique identifier for the credential.
/// - [type]: A list of semantic types describing the credential. Typically includes "VerifiableCredential".
/// - [issuer]: The identifier or DID of the entity that issued the credential.
/// - [issuanceDate]: The date and time when the credential was issued (in ISO 8601 format).
/// - [expirationDate]: The date and time when the credential expires (if applicable, in ISO 8601 format).
/// - [credentialSubject]: The subject of the credential, containing claims about the entity.
/// - [proof]: Cryptographic proof ensuring the validity and authenticity of the credential.
