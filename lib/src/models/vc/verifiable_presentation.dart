/// A model representing a Verifiable Presentation (VP) as defined by the W3C Verifiable Credentials standard.
///
/// A Verifiable Presentation (VP) is a structured format for presenting one or more Verifiable Credentials (VC)
/// along with cryptographic proofs. It is typically used to allow a credential holder to share selected
/// credential attributes while preserving privacy.
///
/// **Key Properties:**
/// - [context]: Defines the JSON-LD context for the presentation, a required component for semantic interoperability.
/// - [type]: A list of types that describe the presentation. Typically includes "VerifiablePresentation".
/// - [holder]: The DID (Decentralized Identifier) or identifier of the entity presenting the VP.
/// - [verifiableCredential]: A list of [VerifiableCredential] objects contained in the presentation.
/// - [proof]: Cryptographic proof ensuring the validity of the presentation and its components.

  /// - [context]: The JSON-LD context defining the semantic structure of the presentation.

  /// - [holder]: The identifier or DID of the holder of the Verifiable Presentation.
  /// - [verifiableCredential]: A list of [VerifiableCredential] objects contained in the presentation.
