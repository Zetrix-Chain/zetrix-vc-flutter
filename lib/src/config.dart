/// An abstract class representing a configuration reader.
///
/// The `ConfigReader` class provides a blueprint for reading configuration data.
/// Subclasses of `ConfigReader` are expected to implement specific logic for
/// reading and managing configurations, such as fetching values from files,
/// databases, or external APIs.
///
/// Since this is an abstract class, it cannot be instantiated directly. Instead,
/// developers need to create concrete implementations of `ConfigReader`
/// and define the required methods for reading configuration values.
abstract class ConfigReader {}
